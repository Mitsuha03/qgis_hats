<p>Because</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Exec #1: Item six on the agenda: "The Meaning of Life" Now uh, Harry, you've had some thoughts on this.</p>

<p>Exec #2: Yeah, I've had a team working on this over the past few weeks, and what we've come up with can be reduced to two fundamental concepts. One: People aren't wearing enough hats. Two: Matter is energy. In the universe there are many energy fields which we cannot normally perceive. Some energies have a spiritual source which act upon a person's soul. However, this "soul" does not exist ab initio as orthodox Christianity teaches; it has to be brought into existence by a process of guided self-observation. However, this is rarely achieved owing to man's unique ability to be distracted from spiritual matters by everyday trivia.</p>

<p>Exec #3: What was that about hats again?</p>

<p>Exec #2: Oh, Uh... people aren't wearing enough.</p>

<p>Exec #1: Is this true?</p>

<p>Exec #4: Certainly. Hat sales have increased but not pari passu, as our research...</p>

<p>Exec #3: [Interrupting] "Not wearing enough"? enough for what purpose?</p>

<p>Exec #5: Can I just ask, with reference to your second point, when you say souls don't develop because people become distracted...</p>

<p>Create a png file in SoManyHats using the following format:</p>

<p><code>{month}-{day}.png</code></p>

<p>or just <code>{month}.png</code> if it's to conver a full month.</p>
