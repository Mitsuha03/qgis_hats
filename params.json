One: People aren't wearing enough hats. Two: Matter is energy. In the universe there are many energy fields which we cannot normally perceive. Some energies have a spiritual source which act upon a person's soul. However, this \"soul\" does not exist ab initio as orthodox Christianity teaches; it has to be brought into existence by a process of guided self-observation. However, this is rarely achieved owing to man's unique ability to be distracted from spiritual matters by everyday trivia.\r\n\r\n> Exec #3: What was that about hats again?\r\n\r\n> Exec #2: Oh, Uh... people aren't wearing enough.\r\n\r\n> Exec #1: Is this true?\r\n\r\n> Exec #4: Certainly. Hat sales have increased but not pari passu, as our research...\r\n\r\n> Exec #3: [Interrupting] \"Not wearing enough\"? enough for what purpose?\r\n\r\n> Exec #5: Can I just ask, with reference to your second point, when you say souls don't develop because people become distracted...\r\n\r\n## Install\r\n\r\nJust install using the plugin installer. Done.  You now get daily/monthly hats for your QGIS logo. \r\n\r\nIt's pretty much a win win for you, QGIS, and hats all around the world.\r\n\r\n## Adding a new hat?\r\n\r\nCreate a png file in SoManyHats using the following format:\r\n\r\n`{month}-{day}.png`\r\n\r\nor just `{month}.png` if it's to conver a full month.\r\n\r\nHere is a easy example:\r\n\r\n![Alt text](https://github.com/NathanW2/qgis_hats/blob/master/SoManyHats/12-05.png?raw=true \"Title\")\r\n\r\nSend me your PRs! You know you want to!\r\n\r\n",
